# First Portfolio Site
This project is dedicated to  testing a Portfolio by Brandon Castillo.

### Technologies Used ###

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript/jQuery

### Process ###
My process for this project was to divide everything into sections and tackle it accordingly. I started off with the nav bar - followed up by the header - about section and so forth. I created the structure of the HTML first before styling. After the structure, I implemented bootstrap to make sure it is responsive. Afterwards, I implemented smooth scrollimg, testmonials, carousel etc.
