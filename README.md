Technologies Used

HTML5,CSS3, Bootstrap, A little bit of Javascript/Jquery

My process for this project was to divide everything into sections and tackle it accordingly. I started off with the nav bar followed up by the header - about section and so forth. I created the structure of the HTML first before styling. After the structure, I implemented bootstrap to make sure the divs flow correctly and stack. Afterwards, I tried to complete every requirement on the list. Smooth scrollimg, testmonials, carousel etc. I used stackoverflow and google but did my very best to not copy and paste code. I began styling and trying to use jquery but I felt like this project was heavy on html and css. 

The unsolved challenges I have is whether or not I was suppose to use a lot of javascript in this project. I was very unsure but I know I could apply it to some areas such as a carousel if I did not use bootstrap. 

The issues I had relate to the following
- Hamburger menu
- Adding a lightbox to the bootstrap carousel
- In the google developer tools, when you shrink it down to Iphone 5 and below, there is a right area of space than pushes everything to the left. I think bootstrap has a part in that.

My biggest wins is that I felt like I learn something about myself attempting this project. I know that I'm 1% better every time I try create something from nothing. 
I'm happy with my design for a novice and that it is responsive and moderately sleek. I definitely feel like there's plenty of room to grow so I look forward to my learning some more. 

My biggest challenges were the testimonial and hamburger menu. I couldn't figure out how to apply the hamburger from bootstrap because my nav bar is from scratch and bootstrap didn't apply. Some codepens have an extensive list which I didn't want to apply either. The testimonial took way too long and was eating up hours from my day as well.
